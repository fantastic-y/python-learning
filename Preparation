I will follow chromity's instruction and learn Python step by step.
I hope I will finish learning the basic classes of python taught by Derek Banas, mentioned by chromity, in a month.

I am currently using hackerrank to improve Mysql.
This web also is mentioned by chromity.
I will start using it to practise python after I finish the basic classes on youtube.
