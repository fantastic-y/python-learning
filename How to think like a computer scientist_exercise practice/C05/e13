#if you're intrigued by why floating point arithmetic is sometimes inaccurate, on a piece of paper, divide 10 by 3 and write down the decimal result.
#you will find is does not terminate, so you will need an infinitely long sheet of paper.
#the reprensentation of numbers in computer memory or on your calculator has similar problems:
#memory is finite, and some digits may have to be discarded. so small inaccuracies creep in.
#try this script:


import math
a=math.sqrt(2.0)
print(a,a*a)
print(a*a ==2.0)


result:
1.4142135623730951 2.0000000000000004
False
