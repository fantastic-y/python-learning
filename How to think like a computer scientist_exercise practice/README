MY Solutions to "How To Think Like A Computer Scientist 3rd Edition"
I created this folder to save my answers to the exercises in the book mentioned above.
As a beginner of python, I solve the problems in the way I feel "that makes sense!" and get the same result of the patterns presented in the book.
which means
I make mistakes
and
there always other ways to solve the problems.

I would really appreciate that if you could take them as references, point out my mistakes, or add in another way to solve the problem.
peace
